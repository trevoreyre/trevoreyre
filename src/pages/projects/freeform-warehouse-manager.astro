          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Freeform needed a better way to manage inventory across multiple warehouses. Their
            existing system was limited to a single warehouse, only worked on desktop, and lacked
            the UI/UX refinements necessary for efficient day-to-day operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was brought in to redesign and expand the warehouse manager application, transforming
            it into a robust inventory management tool. The result was an intuitive, fully
            responsive system that enabled Freeform to track orders and pallets, coordinate arrival
            and departure dates, and streamline warehouse operations across multiple locations.
          </p>
          <h2>What I did</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Redesigned the application from the ground up, significantly improving UI/UX</li>
            <li>Expanded functionality to support multiple warehouses</li>
            <li>Built interactive warehouse layouts to visualize pallet locations</li>
            <li>Enhanced order and pallet tracking, including overdue shipment detection</li>
            <li>Added billing capabilities based on warehouse storage duration</li>
            <li>Made the application fully responsive for phones, tablets, and desktops</li>
            <li>Ensured full keyboard accessibility for improved usability</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            The redesigned warehouse manager significantly improved Freeform’s inventory tracking
            and warehouse operations. With a more intuitive UI, enhanced tracking features, and
            support for multiple warehouses, the system became a critical tool in Freeform’s
            logistics workflow.
