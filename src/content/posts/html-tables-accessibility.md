Make `th` focusable with `tabindex="0"` if it can be clicked, like sortable columns. Maybe it should be a button inside so it can interact like a button?

Make `tr` focusable if you can click a row. IE, selecting a row.

Make sure every row/column has a header. Add an invisible header for cells like a checkbox that you don't want a visible label for. Or an `aria-label`

`tfoot`

Use `th` in `tbody` rows, when applicable.
