I’ve looked a number of times for a way to have ESLint automatically fix imports for me. I don’t know why, but I was always unable to find anything. But I believe I’ve finally done it!

2024-12-08 update - I found an even better plugin, `eslint-plugin-perfectionist`. This one can sort imports, exports, objects, arrays, HTML attributes, JSX props, and more!
