Always have an answer to the question “Why are you interested in working here?” Do a little research on the company (it doesn’t have to be a lot, just enough to show that you’ve looked into them) and come up with an answer to that question.

Know what you’re going to say when they ask about your salary expectations. And also **write down the salary you told them**. It will often come up multiple times in the interview process, and if you say one number in the first interview, and a totally different number in another, it doesn’t look great.
